&lt;p&gt;If you have downloaded the latest version of the Model My Diet app, you might notice something different. Aside from being able to pinpoint your current weight by the decimal, you can now track how often you weigh in daily. It makes weighing in more fun and personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/success-stories/eric-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;eric&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one of our key staff members, Eric, developed the tool, he decided to test it out to help his own struggle with weight loss. Eric is discipling himself to get back into shape, only eating 1600 calories a day. He tries his best to stick to his diet, but any man with two daughters and a busy work schedule can find losing weight a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many, he has always struggled with being overweight and is anxious to see the progress of his efforts.  So he has challenged himself by using our new tool to weigh in daily. As soon he gets up, he sees the reminder on the app to weigh in and steps on his digital scale in anticipation for the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it can be frustrating to see minimal changes on a day to day basis, but he sees it as a rewarding feeling to be given a star every time he weighs in. For everyday he gets a star, he is motivated to continue forward with his strict diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has even gone as far as changing his food environment; cooking for himself, measuring each portion and calorie intake, and favoring healthy alternatives to his favorite meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His love of baking bread and making pizza has been abandoned and instead replaced with his talent for mixing healthy vegetable/fruit cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many helpful ways to monitor your weight loss. Some dieters go as far as adding beads to a “pounds lost” jar. However, not everyone can carry around a jar of beads to show off their accomplishments. Seeing the amount of days weighed in through stars is a reminder to keep going.
The biggest challenge is weighing in everyday, but every time you do is rewarding. For every time Eric pressed “save”, he was starting his day with an accomplishment. Eric is now enjoying a weigh-in streak of 47 days with no plans of stopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/success-stories/eric-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;eric&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He attributes his weight loss to checking his weight daily, integrating his fitness apps with the Model My Diet app, and having an incredible amount of energy and will power. As Eric says, “Will power requires a lot of energy”, but with easy-to-use tools, you will reach your goal model’s weight in no time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Helping You Weigh In Daily: The new tool that is going to change your weight loss struggle.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/img/success-stories/eric.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">3 New Fitness Health Trends to Try Now and 2 to Avoid</title><link href="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/health-trends" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="3 New Fitness Health Trends to Try Now and 2 to Avoid" /><published>2019-03-07T08:49:27+08:00</published><updated>2019-03-07T08:49:27+08:00</updated><id>mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/health-trends</id><content type="html" xml:base="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/health-trends">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/dietplan1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diet plan&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As human beings we like to go with popular opinion, which is why health and fitness schemes are so popular. It seems as though a new program, diet, or exercise workout pops up on our social media feeds every day. However, not every plan works for everyone! We all need to find the perfect routine that works for us individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we navigate the waters of the ever-changing world of fitness and find something that will work for us? Check out this guide to learn about three new health trends that can be adjusted to your schedule, and two that you definitely want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/brain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--the-mind-diet&quot;&gt;TRY – The Mind Diet&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, the MIND diet combines two popular diets: The Mediterranean Diet and the DASH Diet. This diet is not only designed to lose weight and stay fit, but also to improve brain health and prevent dementia. Therefore, this regimen focuses on healthy foods such as fruit, leafy vegetables, olive oil, fish, beans, and wine that are known to improve cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--water-based-hiit&quot;&gt;TRY – Water-based HIIT&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts have been all the rage in the past couple of years. HIIT burns tons of calories by alternating between quick high-intensity workouts with short resting periods. It is said to highly increase your metabolic rate and help you burn calories faster. However, this year, water is all the rage and HIIT is coming off-shore and diving into the deep end. Many gyms are offering HIIT circuit class trainings in pools to offer more of a workout. Water provides added resistance to high-intensity cardio and maximizes the benefits of HIIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/water-hiit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water-hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--cruise-control-diet&quot;&gt;TRY – Cruise Control Diet&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cruise Control Diet is specifically designed for yo-yo dieters, or people that tend to fall in and out of diets. Since it can be hard to follow a strict diet, the Cruise Control Diet has four simple rules as follows: don’t count calories, eat natural foods, avoid processed foods, and enjoy guilty pleasures every now and then. These guidelines make the diet easy to follow and has become one of the highest rated diet programs of 2017. It is not just a diet, but a way towards a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;avoid--souping&quot;&gt;AVOID – Souping&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juicing has become a huge movement in recent years. However, now the trend has shifted towards souping. While souping can be a better choice than juicing, it eliminates key nutrients that are needed to stay healthy. According to dieticians, people on the souping diet miss out on a lot of protein and fiber. It is also difficult to stick to the diet plan as it can be rather boring and bland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/soup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;souping&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;avoid--things-that-shake&quot;&gt;AVOID – Things that Shake&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are attracted to equipment that make exercise easier. However, it’s time to face the truth –– exercise isn’t easy! You can’t buy a machine that will simply shake the weight off of your body. The vibrating lap belts and Shake Weights that you see advertised on your television screen are unfortunately a gimmick to make money. Users of these devices report that they did not increase their muscular strength and did not lose weight. You are better off saving your money and investing in a gym. Remember –– before jumping on the band wagon it is important that you do your research to avoid wasting time and money on false fitness fads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/benefits-of-hiit-training.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-hiit&quot;&gt;The Benefits of HIIT&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Intensity Interval Training (known as HIIT) is a workout technique that alternates between bursts of high-intensity exercise and short periods of recovery or less extreme activity. This type of workout is known to reap the muscle-strengthening benefits while burning off fat, all within a shorter timeframe than traditional exercise routines. A session of high-intensity interval training will push you to reach a high heart rate, as you complete as many reps as you possibly can. For instance, one would sprint for 10 to 20 seconds followed by a short period of walking before repeating intense activity again. This routine will ultimately force your body use more oxygen which causes your metabolism to work at a higher level than normal — allowing you to burn more calories during your workout and even hours later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;more-time-efficient&quot;&gt;More Time Efficient&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike continuous training that can take up to an hour at the gym, HIIT is great for any busy schedule, as workouts can be done under less than half the amount of time without the fancy equipment. Your options are quite endless with what you can incorporate into your personal HIIT sessions. Anything from running to cycling or even traditional push-ups and jumping lunges, this workout technique can be done almost anywhere at anytime, no matter the constraints!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;improves-your-cardiovascular-health&quot;&gt;Improves Your Cardiovascular Health&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since HIIT involves exertion that your body isn’t necessarily used to, you will most likely find your heart trying to jump out of your chest. However, studies have shown that after incorporating a few of these highly intensive, yet brief workouts to your routine, an improvement to your cardiovascular health can be seen in as little as two weeks. These bursts of rigorous activity have also demonstrated enhancements in how blood vessels transport blood through the body, while heightening brain activity. Overall, HIIT is not only beneficial to those who want to lose weight, but also to people who are looking to strengthen their cardiovascular fitness and better their circulatory system, which will ultimately help them to succeed in lasting longer during future workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;boosts-endurance&quot;&gt;Boosts Endurance&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with providing enhancements to your overall health, it’s no shock that high-intensity workouts will boost your endurance as well. This workout regimen will allow you to tolerate higher levels of intensity for a longer period of time which makes HIIT easier to maintain than continuous, low to moderate-intensity exercise. Another huge positive to this type of training is the fact that it’s easier on body joints, which can become problematic for long distance runners in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/running.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water-hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;easier-to-maintain&quot;&gt;Easier To Maintain&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional low to moderate-training that many people incorporate into their routine, high-intensity interval training will keep you on your toes. Not only are you not tied to fancy gym equipment, but your options remain unlimited in terms of what you can do for intensive activities and where you do them! In fact, many of those who have tried HIIT, end up sticking with it for a much longer time. This is no shock as HIIT leaves you with less time to be bored since you are constantly diversifying your workout routine, all while building up endurance!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jess1818</name></author><summary type="html">Why High-Intensity Interval Training Works</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/img/blog-img/benefits-of-hiit-training.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight</title><link href="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/embracing-curves" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight" /><published>2019-03-05T08:49:27+08:00</published><updated>2019-03-05T08:49:27+08:00</updated><id>mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/embracing-curves</id><content type="html" xml:base="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/embracing-curves">&lt;h1 id=&quot;embracing-curves-and-finding-your-healthy-weight&quot;&gt;Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;scale&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about finding their healthy weight, they often mention Body Mass Index or BMI — a measure of relative size based on body mass and height. Medical professionals may use this value as a marker to determine an individuals weight category or a specific weight range that they fall within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/bmi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bmi&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While BMI can be very useful in determining a loose idea of average weight, there are many factors that it fails to take into account, and therefore it shouldn’t be used as the only indication of overall health. Many professional athletes are considered to be overweight based on their BMI since muscle weighs more than normal tissue or fat deposits. Women with larger than average busts also often find themselves on the wrong side of the BMI scale, even if their waist and hip measurements are well within the average for their height, because of the weight of their breasts. So how can you determine what body weight is healthy for you? And when is it time to stop worrying about your weight and accept that your curves are healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;exercise-regularly&quot;&gt;Exercise Regularly&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you can do is stop focusing on how much you weigh and start focusing on how healthy you are instead. This means saying goodbye to fad diets and hello to regular exercise. It is better to be fit than thin, and consistent exercise will make you stronger and less vulnerable to viruses that pose threats to your immune system. Traditional exercise will also increase your muscle and bone strength, leaving you less susceptible to the risks of osteoporosis as you age, including the added benefit of making your body appear leaner, even if your weight doesn’t actually change when you step on the scale. In fact, why not throw your scale away and instead of measuring your weight, choose other variables to keep track of? Measure how many hours of exercise you fit in each week or how many of your five a day you eat. By focusing on healthy habits instead of your weight you will live a healthier overall lifestyle. This is particularly important for individuals that have experienced disordered eating or who are prone to obsessive thoughts who may find that looking at the numbers on the scale on a weekly basis is detrimental to their overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/running-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;running&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;eat-right&quot;&gt;Eat Right&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we may ignore the rules now and again, we all know which foods are healthy and which are laden with saturated fats. We also know that we should aim to eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, and that fruit makes a better snack than chocolate. A good way to assess how healthy your diet really is to write down everything you eat over the course of a week. Include everything in your food journal — all of those afternoon snacks and every quick pick-me-up from Starbucks. We often think we are eating healthier than we are because we forget to count our small snacks and treats. By writing down exactly what you eat, you will have a clear picture of how healthy your diet really is, and will be able to see where you need to make changes without worrying about your weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/healthy-foods.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;healthy foods&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reassess-your-normal&quot;&gt;Reassess Your “Normal”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons that women strive so hard to reduce their weight, and to fit into those size zero jeans, is because the media presents the idea that all women are slim, and that women who do not fit this have failed. Not only is this not true, it is ridiculous! Look around you and you will see happy and healthy women that come in all shapes and sizes. Being strong and healthy are better markers to judge yourself rather than just your number on the scale. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be considering weight loss — many of us do have a few pounds to lose to reach our ideal size and shape, and there are changes we can make to our diet and lifestyle that will help us to reach our goals. However, weight loss isn’t the most important target. By reassessing your normal, moving your goalposts to something that is healthy and realistic for your body shape, and accepting yourself for who you are, you will find that you are both happier and healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/detox-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No two people are the same — especially when it comes to their diets. That is why it’s essential to adapt a regimen tailored to suit our body and attend to our own unique nutritional needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, maintaining a healthy balance of wholesome foods in our diet and more importantly keeping things in moderation is key. But for many, our modern day lifestyles get in the way of sustaining balance when it comes to eating healthy and exercising. Stuck in an age where we are constantly looking for shortcuts to help squeeze out every last minute of the day, it’s no surprise that we resort to the quicker and easier way of dieting. But just how effective are these alternative ways of losing weight? Do they actually work or are they just another fallacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/detox-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-is-a-detox&quot;&gt;What is a Detox?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s dive into the details involving the popular “detox diet”. There is no one particular detox out there — in fact there are several different types that involve either fasting, drinking cleansing juices, taking pills or other diets that restrict the consumption of certain foods. Regardless of which type of detox one chooses, the important thing to recognize is that they aren’t as promising as they sound. In actuality, they have not proven to accomplish what they say they will, which is to flush toxins from the body. If your goal is to ultimately cleanse your body from “harmful” substances, your best approach is a traditional clean-eating regimen. This is one that limits high in fat and sugar foods, by replacing them with naturally grown, raw whole foods. Cutting down on processed foods that many of our diets are overfilled with will also help achieve a more realistic long-term goal. However, science has in fact proven that the removal of stored toxic substances is a continuous process that the body undergoes naturally, regardless of whether or not we attempt to flush them through a diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/detox-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;losing-weight-without-exercise&quot;&gt;Losing Weight Without Exercise&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that you have heard about the several cleansing diets that are solely based on the consumption of pills, juices or limited foods and do not involve any form of exercise in order to lose weight. To many, the sound of not having to go through extensive training in order to achieve results may sound appealing, which has no wonder drawn popularity to these weight-reduction strategies. These forms of dieting may often yield in weight loss mainly due to their extreme nature and the fact that they restrict many foods or occasionally entire food groups. Of course, while it is possible to shed weight by cutting calories through a detox, skipping out on gym time will likely result in a decrease in muscle mass. What many people do not realize is that the less muscle mass your body has, the less energy (and in turn, calories) you use. It is safe to say that many of these diets do not involve much physical activity because they are in fact so low in calories that people often feel weak or simply do not have enough energy to burn off in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-verdict&quot;&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s indisputable that going cold turkey or making excessive cuts to your daily intake will without a doubt send your body into shock. However, by maintaining a lifestyle consistently overtime rather than putting a complete halt to one is much more effective, and more importantly easier on the body. It’s important to realize that although the pounds may shed at a rapid rate when detoxing for some, weight can quickly pack on once you end the diet. To increase the likelihood of long-term success in regards to achieving your healthy weight, smaller changes are recommended over dramatic ones. In most cases, conventional dieting methods of losing weight including exercise, although can be initially slower in yielding weight loss results, have proven to be more advantageous in the long haul when maintaining goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-to-get-started&quot;&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t know where to begin? Not to worry — starting off a new regimen may be intimidating, especially when you have what seems to be an impossible goal to reach. Begin by making just one small change. For instance, add a portion of veggies with your lunch or make an effort to eat dinner at an earlier time. These small changes will remain easy to manage and maintain through longer periods of time as oppose to struggling to keep up with dieting fads. Remember, this is more than simply your caloric intake. All-around health involves the intricacies of physical, mental and emotional balance. Keep your mind alert and your heart happy! Start by focusing on your entire body as a series of mechanisms working together to keep it in its best shape possible. And just as mentioned off the top, moderation is the key to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jess1818</name></author><summary type="html">All Things Detox — The Facts &amp;amp; Myths You Should Know</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/img/blog-img/detox-4.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Relationship Between Body Image and Disordered Eating</title><link href="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/body-image" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Relationship Between Body Image and Disordered Eating" /><published>2019-03-03T08:49:27+08:00</published><updated>2019-03-03T08:49:27+08:00</updated><id>mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/body-image</id><content type="html" xml:base="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/body-image">&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-relationship-between-body-image-and-disordered-eating&quot;&gt;The Relationship Between Body Image and Disordered Eating&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who want to lose weight, there’s a fine line between healthy and unhealthy methods of losing the extra pounds. Often, the way we think about our bodies—our body image—contributes to our ability to lose weight in a healthy and safe manner. With a positive body image, weight loss attempts often tend to be healthier, safer, and ultimately more successful. However, because poor body image contributes to the risk of someone developing an eating disorder, healthy weight loss is more difficult for people who see their bodies in a negative light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a strong two-way relationship between body image and eating disorders: someone with a poor or unrealistic body image often desires to change their body, and the most common way for this desire to manifest is by dieting. For some people, the result is the eventual development of an eating disorder, which causes body image to become even more distorted. For example, someone with poor body image who develops anorexia thinks of themselves as overweight even if they lose so much that they become dangerously underweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/body-image-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people with eating disorders develop such a distorted body image that they develop a condition called body dysmorphic disorder. People with this disorder become very preoccupied with their physical appearance, and with particular facial features or parts of their bodies; typically their preoccupation causes them to see serious flaws where none exist. A study conducted at UCLA shows that people with this disorder may actually have abnormal visual processing—and that they do literally see themselves differently from the way they really are.
When someone with an eating disorder also develops body dysmorphic disorder, there’s a high risk that their eating disorder will eventually become fatal, which means that getting professional help is extremely important for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/simple-ways-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started on a new workout routine may be tough but improving your diet doesn’t have to be. Instead of going cold turkey or making drastic changes which is often what many try and fail to stay consistent with, focus on your current regimen and make one small change at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;skip-the-soda&quot;&gt;Skip the soda&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swap the soda out for water. If you are the type who finds water incredibly boring to drink, change it up a bit. Add a few slices of lemon and make things even more interesting by adding different berries, or grab some mint leaves from the garden. This will provide the refreshing flavour without any added calories or sugar which soda is loaded with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/simple-ways-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cut-down-on-processed-sugar&quot;&gt;Cut down on processed sugar&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a way to cut down on sugar while still fulfilling your sweet tooth. For instance, ditch the slice of cake and have a bowl of fruit instead. This will keep you feeling energized and provide you with additional vitamins and minerals that you would not get from traditional dessert that’s overfilled with processed sugars and fats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;dont-cut-out-your-favourite-foods&quot;&gt;Don’t cut out your favourite foods&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, don’t say goodbye to your favourite delicacies! Instead, try to improve the amount of control you have when it comes to indulging. For many, cheat days can be an effective way to do so by allowing only small portions of comfort foods — as long as nutritional goals are being met throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/simple-ways-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;keep-a-food-diary&quot;&gt;Keep a food diary&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep track of your progress by what you consume and how you feel after eating particular foods. This will not only give a better understanding of your personal eating habits but also help you to become more mindful of what you eat in the future. Keeping a food journal for just one week has been proven to help those dieting pinpoint exactly where they need improvement when it comes to nutritional needs as well. It’s also a great help for those who meal prep during the work week, keeping ideas of what to cook organized and can even lower your grocery bill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/simple-ways-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;clean-out-your-cupboards&quot;&gt;Clean out your cupboards&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of sight, out of mind! Do some kitchen cleaning and clear out the junk from the cupboards. Many people find themselves snacking on unhealthy foods because they are simply surrounded by them. Purging processed foods will not only help control your unwanted cravings but also help with future eating habits in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jess1818</name></author><summary type="html">5 Simple Ways To Improve Your Diet</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/img/blog-img/simple-ways-2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Losing Weight While Enjoying Your Favourite Summer Foods</title><link href="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/summer-foods" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Losing Weight While Enjoying Your Favourite Summer Foods" /><published>2019-03-01T08:49:27+08:00</published><updated>2019-03-01T08:49:27+08:00</updated><id>mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/favorite-summer-foods</id><content type="html" xml:base="mastroneel.github.io/model-my-lifestyle-demo/summer-foods">&lt;h5 id=&quot;losing-weight-while-enjoying-your-favourite-summer-foods&quot;&gt;Losing Weight While Enjoying Your Favourite Summer Foods&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/summer-foods-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With winter slowly coming to an end, patio season is just around the corner, which means cold brews and lip smacking BBQ! Although we love this time of year, sometimes our diets limit us in terms of how much of this season we can truly enjoy. The good news is, if you are already using the Model My Diet App for tracking your weight loss progress, you are probably already following a healthy diet. Study after study has shown that you don’t need to starve, count calories excessively, or forego your favourite foods to lose excess pounds. Barbecues are a quintessentially American pastime; one that gathers friends and family, who enjoy the smoky flavour and aroma of this low-fat way of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wondered whether or not you could still enjoy summer barbecues while on a weight loss program, the answer, is yes –– the secret simply lies in the ingredients!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/summer-foods-2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some diets which are proving equally popular among doctors, scientists, and fitness enthusiasts, are the Mediterranean and Paleo diets. The Ketogenic (or Atkins-type) diet is also favoured by many, owing to its emphasis on a low-carbohydrate, low-sugar way of living. These diets work perfectly well with barbecues, because you can make a selection from a wide range of lean protein sources, fruits and vegetables, all of which taste wonderful when cooked on the grill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common for doctors to recommend both the Mediterranean and Paleo diets because of their emphasis on lean quality protein sources, seasonal fruits and vegetables, and healthy Omega-3 fats. Unlike diets which prescribe specific meal plans, weighing of food etc., the main work involved in preparing for these diets, is the shopping and preparation time they involve. It is easy to get around this by carefully writing down everything you will need for at least a week, and filling your fridge with healthy foods so that you don’t feel tempted to binge on fast food or processed alternatives when you come home from a tiring day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/summer-foods-3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By chopping up lettuce, vegetables, and other ingredients and storing them in different airtight containers, you can whip up your favourite salad or barbecue side quickly, without having to clean and chop ingredients every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;tips-for-healthy--tasty-barbecues&quot;&gt;Tips for Healthy &amp;amp; Tasty Barbecues&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keen barbecuers know that the secret to success, lies in the marinade. All American states have their own grilling styles and marinades, and you can remain true to your traditions –– as well as try out new recipes, by making a few simple changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take wet Memphis ribs for instance, often made with a sweet tomato-and-vinegar sauce. It is easy to adapt this recipe, using stevia or xylitol instead of sugar, keeping it on the savory side, avoiding unnecessary added sugars. You can also try new recipes for sauces. The Alabama sandwich sauce, a white sauce containing homemade mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, salt, pepper, horseradish and cayenne, can work perfectly well in an Atkins-style diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/summer-foods-4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbecued dishes, whether meat or veggies work fantastically for Paleo, Keto and Mediterranean diets; essentially, the primary consideration should be taking extra care with the ingredients you use for sauces and marinade. Replace sugar with low carb, natural (not artificial) sweeteners and use them sparingly; serve healthy sides such as salads and barbecued veggies, foregoing rich sauces in favour of simple yet healthy alternatives made with ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, lemon and garlic. The best thing about enjoying a barbecue while on a diet, is that nobody will even notice that anything has changed –– because every bite will taste as lip smackingly delicious at it always has.&lt;/p&gt;
