&lt;p&gt;As human beings we like to go with popular opinion, which is why health and fitness schemes are so popular. It seems as though a new program, diet, or exercise workout pops up on our social media feeds every day. However, not every plan works for everyone! We all need to find the perfect routine that works for us individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we navigate the waters of the ever-changing world of fitness and find something that will work for us? Check out this guide to learn about three new health trends that can be adjusted to your schedule, and two that you definitely want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/brain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--the-mind-diet&quot;&gt;TRY – The Mind Diet&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, the MIND diet combines two popular diets: The Mediterranean Diet and the DASH Diet. This diet is not only designed to lose weight and stay fit, but also to improve brain health and prevent dementia. Therefore, this regimen focuses on healthy foods such as fruit, leafy vegetables, olive oil, fish, beans, and wine that are known to improve cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--water-based-hiit&quot;&gt;TRY – Water-based HIIT&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts have been all the rage in the past couple of years. HIIT burns tons of calories by alternating between quick high-intensity workouts with short resting periods. It is said to highly increase your metabolic rate and help you burn calories faster. However, this year, water is all the rage and HIIT is coming off-shore and diving into the deep end. Many gyms are offering HIIT circuit class trainings in pools to offer more of a workout. Water provides added resistance to high-intensity cardio and maximizes the benefits of HIIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/water-hiit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water-hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;try--cruise-control-diet&quot;&gt;TRY – Cruise Control Diet&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cruise Control Diet is specifically designed for yo-yo dieters, or people that tend to fall in and out of diets. Since it can be hard to follow a strict diet, the Cruise Control Diet has four simple rules as follows: don’t count calories, eat natural foods, avoid processed foods, and enjoy guilty pleasures every now and then. These guidelines make the diet easy to follow and has become one of the highest rated diet programs of 2017. It is not just a diet, but a way towards a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;avoid--souping&quot;&gt;AVOID – Souping&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juicing has become a huge movement in recent years. However, now the trend has shifted towards souping. While souping can be a better choice than juicing, it eliminates key nutrients that are needed to stay healthy. According to dieticians, people on the souping diet miss out on a lot of protein and fiber. It is also difficult to stick to the diet plan as it can be rather boring and bland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/soup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;souping&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;avoid--things-that-shake&quot;&gt;AVOID – Things that Shake&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are attracted to equipment that make exercise easier. However, it’s time to face the truth –– exercise isn’t easy! You can’t buy a machine that will simply shake the weight off of your body. The vibrating lap belts and Shake Weights that you see advertised on your television screen are unfortunately a gimmick to make money. Users of these devices report that they did not increase their muscular strength and did not lose weight. You are better off saving your money and investing in a gym. Remember –– before jumping on the band wagon it is important that you do your research to avoid wasting time and money on false fitness fads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/benefits-of-hiit-training.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-hiit&quot;&gt;The Benefits of HIIT&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Intensity Interval Training (known as HIIT) is a workout technique that alternates between bursts of high-intensity exercise and short periods of recovery or less extreme activity. This type of workout is known to reap the muscle-strengthening benefits while burning off fat, all within a shorter timeframe than traditional exercise routines. A session of high-intensity interval training will push you to reach a high heart rate, as you complete as many reps as you possibly can. For instance, one would sprint for 10 to 20 seconds followed by a short period of walking before repeating intense activity again. This routine will ultimately force your body use more oxygen which causes your metabolism to work at a higher level than normal — allowing you to burn more calories during your workout and even hours later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;more-time-efficient&quot;&gt;More Time Efficient&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike continuous training that can take up to an hour at the gym, HIIT is great for any busy schedule, as workouts can be done under less than half the amount of time without the fancy equipment. Your options are quite endless with what you can incorporate into your personal HIIT sessions. Anything from running to cycling or even traditional push-ups and jumping lunges, this workout technique can be done almost anywhere at anytime, no matter the constraints!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;improves-your-cardiovascular-health&quot;&gt;Improves Your Cardiovascular Health&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since HIIT involves exertion that your body isn’t necessarily used to, you will most likely find your heart trying to jump out of your chest. However, studies have shown that after incorporating a few of these highly intensive, yet brief workouts to your routine, an improvement to your cardiovascular health can be seen in as little as two weeks. These bursts of rigorous activity have also demonstrated enhancements in how blood vessels transport blood through the body, while heightening brain activity. Overall, HIIT is not only beneficial to those who want to lose weight, but also to people who are looking to strengthen their cardiovascular fitness and better their circulatory system, which will ultimately help them to succeed in lasting longer during future workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;boosts-endurance&quot;&gt;Boosts Endurance&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with providing enhancements to your overall health, it’s no shock that high-intensity workouts will boost your endurance as well. This workout regimen will allow you to tolerate higher levels of intensity for a longer period of time which makes HIIT easier to maintain than continuous, low to moderate-intensity exercise. Another huge positive to this type of training is the fact that it’s easier on body joints, which can become problematic for long distance runners in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/running.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water-hiit&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;easier-to-maintain&quot;&gt;Easier To Maintain&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional low to moderate-training that many people incorporate into their routine, high-intensity interval training will keep you on your toes. Not only are you not tied to fancy gym equipment, but your options remain unlimited in terms of what you can do for intensive activities and where you do them! In fact, many of those who have tried HIIT, end up sticking with it for a much longer time. This is no shock as HIIT leaves you with less time to be bored since you are constantly diversifying your workout routine, all while building up endurance!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why High-Intensity Interval Training Works</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/img/blog-img/benefits-of-hiit-training.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight</title><link href="/embracing-curves" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight" /><published>2019-03-05T08:49:27+08:00</published><updated>2019-03-05T08:49:27+08:00</updated><id>/embracing-curves</id><content type="html" xml:base="/embracing-curves">&lt;h1 id=&quot;embracing-curves-and-finding-your-healthy-weight&quot;&gt;Embracing Curves and Finding Your Healthy Weight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;scale&quot; title=&quot;image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about finding their healthy weight, they often mention Body Mass Index or BMI — a measure of relative size based on body mass and height. Medical professionals may use this value as a marker to determine an individuals weight category or a specific weight range that they fall within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/bmi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bmi&quot; title=&quot;image-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While BMI can be very useful in determining a loose idea of average weight, there are many factors that it fails to take into account, and therefore it shouldn’t be used as the only indication of overall health. Many professional athletes are considered to be overweight based on their BMI since muscle weighs more than normal tissue or fat deposits. Women with larger than average busts also often find themselves on the wrong side of the BMI scale, even if their waist and hip measurements are well within the average for their height, because of the weight of their breasts. So how can you determine what body weight is healthy for you? And when is it time to stop worrying about your weight and accept that your curves are healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;exercise-regularly&quot;&gt;Exercise Regularly&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you can do is stop focusing on how much you weigh and start focusing on how healthy you are instead. This means saying goodbye to fad diets and hello to regular exercise. It is better to be fit than thin, and consistent exercise will make you stronger and less vulnerable to viruses that pose threats to your immune system. Traditional exercise will also increase your muscle and bone strength, leaving you less susceptible to the risks of osteoporosis as you age, including the added benefit of making your body appear leaner, even if your weight doesn’t actually change when you step on the scale. In fact, why not throw your scale away and instead of measuring your weight, choose other variables to keep track of? Measure how many hours of exercise you fit in each week or how many of your five a day you eat. By focusing on healthy habits instead of your weight you will live a healthier overall lifestyle. This is particularly important for individuals that have experienced disordered eating or who are prone to obsessive thoughts who may find that looking at the numbers on the scale on a weekly basis is detrimental to their overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/running-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;running&quot; title=&quot;image-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;eat-right&quot;&gt;Eat Right&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we may ignore the rules now and again, we all know which foods are healthy and which are laden with saturated fats. We also know that we should aim to eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, and that fruit makes a better snack than chocolate. A good way to assess how healthy your diet really is to write down everything you eat over the course of a week. Include everything in your food journal — all of those afternoon snacks and every quick pick-me-up from Starbucks. We often think we are eating healthier than we are because we forget to count our small snacks and treats. By writing down exactly what you eat, you will have a clear picture of how healthy your diet really is, and will be able to see where you need to make changes without worrying about your weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog-img/healthy-foods.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;healthy foods&quot; title=&quot;image-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reassess-your-normal&quot;&gt;Reassess Your “Normal”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons that women strive so hard to reduce their weight, and to fit into those size zero jeans, is because the media presents the idea that all women are slim, and that women who do not fit this have failed. Not only is this not true, it is ridiculous! Look around you and you will see happy and healthy women that come in all shapes and sizes. Being strong and healthy are better markers to judge yourself rather than just your number on the scale. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be considering weight loss — many of us do have a few pounds to lose to reach our ideal size and shape, and there are changes we can make to our diet and lifestyle that will help us to reach our goals. However, weight loss isn’t the most important target. By reassessing your normal, moving your goalposts to something that is healthy and realistic for your body shape, and accepting yourself for who you are, you will find that you are both happier and healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;
