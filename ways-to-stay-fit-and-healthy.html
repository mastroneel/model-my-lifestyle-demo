<h5 id="ways-to-stay-fit-and-healthy">Ways to Stay Fit and Healthy</h5>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-1.jpeg" alt="image" title="image-1" /></p>

<p>We are all unique in our own ways which is why the way we manage staying fit and healthy will differ. Until you find a good rhythm that works for your body, it can be difficult knowing how to get there. Let’s begin with some universal tips on successfully getting on track to staying fit and healthy!</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-2.jpg" alt="image" title="image-2" /></p>

<h5 id="stay-hydrated">Stay Hydrated</h5>

<p>We’ve all heard doctors, dieticians and health activists say that drinking enough water daily and staying hydrated is crucial for our overall health and well-being. Although drinking water is essential, what many of us don’t consider are the endless benefits that come from consuming the daily recommended amount or possibly even more. Staying hydrated serves as a natural cleanser for our organs and the digestive system, which ultimately regulate our metabolism — favourable for weight loss strategies. Since we are constantly losing fluids through bodily processes, we must be replenishing it to maintain good health and avoid dehydration, which can be accentuated through strenuous activity and being exposed to warmer climates. Water also aids in the function of your kidneys which can improve cleansing and getting rid of any toxins or waste in your body.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-3.jpeg" alt="image" title="image-3" /></p>

<p>So if you find drinking plain water boring, not to worry — there are several ways to get in an ample amount of fluids. In fact, many foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables that you would not think of, have a high water content. The options are certainly far from just drinking a glass of water. To start, try adding a few slices of lemon or cucumber to your next sip. Furthermore, drinking a warm cup of tea is a great option on those cold days, especially for the added antioxidants!</p>

<h5 id="get-plenty-of-rest">Get Plenty of Rest</h5>

<p>Getting a sufficient amount of shut-eye every night is imperative for our overall health and well-being. Sleep not only affects our physical and mental health, but also has a strong influence on our performance during the day, as well as productivity. Since the recommended hours of sleep differs according to age, it is important to consider your personal needs as well as overall lifestyle that may play a part in affecting your amount and quality of rest. Just as following a healthy diet and exercise regimen are important for good health, so is our sleep. In fact, primary restorative functions occur exclusively during our sleep including: tissue repair, muscle growth and protein synthesis. An adequate amount of rest simply allows the body to heal, repair and rejuvenate itself— things that it cannot do while it’s awake and working.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-4.jpg" alt="image" title="image-4" /></p>

<p>There are several factors that may impact the amount and quality of sleep we get such as: stimulants like coffee or energy drinks, and exposure to blue light from electronic devices we are constantly on, being smartphones to laptops. Possible long-term implications on our health due to insufficient amount of sleep have slowly been uncovered by researchers and linked to illnesses such as obesity, poor immune function, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It is no shock that not getting enough rest has adverse effects on our wellness, taking a hit on our metabolism, mood, concentration, memory and not to mention, life expectancy.</p>

<h5 id="stay-active-and-motivated">Stay Active And Motivated</h5>

<p>For many, finding and getting into a fixed routine as well as being consistent with working out that may seem out of reach. Since no two people are the same, neither are their workout regimes. That’s why finding a custom workout routine is imperative. Working out 3 to 4 times a week is a great starting point if you aren’t doing it already. Always remember, any time spent being active is better than sitting around! To stay motivated, simply focus your attention on how you will feel once you finish your workout rather than other things like how you want to look. Don’t be wrapped up around seeing results quickly –– it’s a process!</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-5.jpeg" alt="image" title="image-5" /></p>

<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of where to start, consider cardio. Cardiovascular exercise helps strengthen the body’s heart and lungs –– the organs that work the hardest to keep us breathing! If you are looking to progress in your fitness journey, be sure to change up your routine every 4-6 weeks to prevent a workout plateau. This can easily be done by innovating your workouts by adding more resistance to make them more challenging for yourself! Overall, the benefits of cardio range from better mental health to physical well-being. So whether you are looking to lose weight, or boost your metabolic rate –– getting active and staying motivated can get you closer to reaching your goal!</p>

<h5 id="eat-well">Eat Well</h5>

<p>Although many people strive to be gym junkies and spend several hours working out, some do not realize that it is in fact equally, if not more important to consider what you fueling your body with. Maintaining a healthy and balanced diet, rich in nutritional value, including essential vitamins and minerals is crucial when you are looking to stay fit and healthy. Taking that step as simple as avoiding processed foods and items with high amounts of artificial sugars can truly be a game changer. Ensure you are eating well-balanced meals such as those that include lean proteins, plenty of fruits and veggies, as well as low-in-fat dairy products.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-img/fit-6.jpg" alt="image" title="image-5" /></p>

<h5 id="consistency-is-key">Consistency Is Key</h5>

<p>Whether you are a beginner or old-timer of the fitness game, staying consistent and keeping everything in moderation is the key to a successful and more importantly, healthy journey. Remember to avoid extremes in any capacity. Try to make small changes and adapt to them overtime rather than making too many drastic cuts in your life — this will risk relapsing to old habits!</p>
